# Customer-churn-using-ML
Customer churn (also known as customer attrition) is the
phenomenon of customers abandoning a brand and ceasing to be a
paying client of a company. Customer churn (attrition) rate refers to the
percentage of customers that stop utilising a company's products or
services within a given time period.
We need data to work with, much like in machine learning jobs. We
determine what data they need to collect based on their objectives. The
data is then prepped, preprocessed, analyzed graphically, and converted
into a format that can be used to create machine learning models and then
their accuracies are tested and compared. Finally we choose the model
having the highest accuracy on the test data.
